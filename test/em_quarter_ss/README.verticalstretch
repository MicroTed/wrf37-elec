Geometric vertical stretch with ideal.exe

config_stretch_z : set to 1 to turn on (default is 0)
dz_bot : dz for k=1 (meters) default 200.
dz_top : maximum dz at top of domain. default 500.
nbndlyr : number of layers at bottom using dz_bot (default 0). E.g., if nbndlyr = 10, then the first 10 levels will have constant dz = dz_bot and then stretch above that.

Domain height is set by the ztop in the domains namelist.

Stretching will fail if the stretch factor is 1.1 or greater. An error message will print. Either increase the number of levels  nz (i.e., e_vert) or adjust dz_bot and dz_top until it succeeds. The 1.1 limit is used to reduce numerical errors in advection that result from a local assumption that dz is constant.
